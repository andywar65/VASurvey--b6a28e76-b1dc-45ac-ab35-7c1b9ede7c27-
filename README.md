# VisualARQ Survey
A VisualARQ Python plugin for survey purposes
## Installation
Clone the repository where your Rhinoceros Python plugins are, change the folder name so that it looks like a proper plugin folder (from `PluginName--Hash-` to `PluginName (Hash)`), restart Rhino. VisualARQ must be installed too.
